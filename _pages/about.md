I am interested in utilizing multiple satellite datasets (e.g., SMAP, MODIS), in-situ observations, and reanalysis products (e.g., ERA5) to investigate how climate variability and human activities affect water resources. My research focuses on developing BERT/GPT-based foundation models that can be fine-tuned for tasks such as streamflow forecasting, soil moisture prediction, and water quality assessment. Additionally, I apply hybrid models that integrate physics-based hydrological approaches with deep learning techniques, ensuring predictions remain both accurate and physically interpretable. Ultimately, my goal is to provide robust, scalable, and transparent modeling frameworks to support decision-making from local watersheds to global scales. My expertise also includes zero-shot forecasting, cross-task transfer learning, and satellite imagery analysis (e.g., detection and segmentation).
